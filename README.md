# Movie Troll
Movie Troll is a movie discussion site where, pretending the internet was void of negative comments, people could come to talk trash about anything movie related.  Using The Movie Database API, a user will search for the movie they want to discuss and post the movie poster and plot for all to see.  Below in the comments for each posting all users can talk about anything they want regarding that movie.

# Technologies Used
 This app was built using Node, Express, and MongoDB.  We also used The Movie Database API for the movie information.  For user verification we used Passport, particularly Passport local strategy.  
 Mockups were done in Balsamic and we versioned with Git and GitHub.
