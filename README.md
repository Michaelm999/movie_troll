 # Movie Troll
Movie Troll is a movie discussion site where, pretending the internet was void of negative comments, people could come to talk trash about anything movie related.  Using The Movie Database API, a user will search for the movie they want to discuss and post the movie poster and plot for all to see.  Below in the comments for each posting all users can talk about anything they want regarding that movie.

# Technologies Used
The app was built in Node, Express, and MongoDB.  The API for fetching movie data is The Movie Database.  User verification is done using Passport, specifically the Passport Local Strategy.  Versioned in Git and GitHub.
